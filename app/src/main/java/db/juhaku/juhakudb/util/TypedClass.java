 *<p>Typed class is used for sub classing a class with generic type which os not sub class
 * itself of generic super class. Sub classing is necessary in order to return generic type of
 * class as generic type can be returned from super class.</p>
 * <code>
 *     Example:<br/><br/>
 *     TestItem&lt;GenericType&gt; item = new TestItem&lt;&gt;();<br/>
 *     Class&lt;GenericType&gt; clazz = ReflectionUtils.getClassGenericTypes(new TypedClass&lt;GenericType&gt;()&#123;&#125;)[0] <br/>
