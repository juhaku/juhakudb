/**
 * Created by juha on 18/04/17.
 *
 * <p>General interface for SQLite database repositories. All the repositories should extend or
 * implement this interface if custom repository is being implemented.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface provides simple SPI for most needed database operations.</p>
 *
 * <p>Currently only creating a interface with {@code @Repository} annotation like below is enough to
 * create instance of repository.</p><br/>
 *
 * <code>@Repository<br/>
 * public interface PersonRepository extends SimpleRepository<Long, Permission> {}</code><br/><br/>
 *
 * <p>To get an instance of the repository in Activity or Fragment or other class you can either use
 * {@code @Inject} annotation or call {@code databaseManager.getRepository(PersonRepository.class)}
 * method.</p>
